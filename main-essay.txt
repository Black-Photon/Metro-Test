This is an essay I'll be working on, documenting some of the work done on Metro

9th Sept:
Today I changed up switch. Before we had it save the WIP state of the repo on a commit called WIP, but now it's changed to work in a seperate branch instead

10th Sept:
Today I wrote patch. Me and Michael had a debate about commenting and terms and eventually finished a working version - you can see in this repo! 'Added test' was patched with an extra file!

24th March:
I made this in September? It's been a while. Worked on some UX stuff.
