Random Test Metro Repo

Metro has Lines and Stuff, as well as commits
Also it's pretty cool

And it has absorb!
...And Sync!

I'm running out of test messages!!!

Blasted a laser towards the Mooooooon!
Yes the Moooooooooon!

When the laser hit's in June, you'll all know the tune
As it goes BOOM! The ship goes ZOOOOM.

But in the end, there's only one space.
And all the competitors, created one great race.

All across the Galaxy, people came to watch.
Until eventually one day, a starship came by.

And everything changed
and again
and yet again
doop

The ship was remarkably small, such that only a half-person could fit inside
But inside, was something nobody could have expected
A time machine!
This strange contraption was initially hard to understand,
But with enough thought, a specific scientist made sense of it
